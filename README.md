# Cruise-Line-Management-System
In this project, we have designed a web-based application on Cruise Line Management.

<b>Abstract:</b><br>
A cruise line is a company that operates cruise ships on oceans or rivers. It is a passenger ship which mainly focuses on vacationing. It is like a mini-hotel on a ship, with most of the facilities one can find in a star hotel. Its main goal is to provide luxury stay while on round-trip voyages to ports of various cities and countries.

Our aim is to demonstrate a cruise line management system using create, insert, update, delete and other SQL operations, to store customer data. It starts with a user registering for a trip on our website. Once that is done, they can enter their personal details, explore and choose different packages for their stay. At the end, the user will receive a confirmation message and a ticket which will display all the sections and package details they have chosen, which can be accessed and updated (if any change is to be made) anytime with the provided log in.

A cruise line has Rooms and Restaurants. A Passenger makes a Transaction for booking the cruise trip through our website. Passengers on a cruise can visit many, but can board and depart at one Destination. Passengers check into their booked Rooms. Passengers dine at a variety of Restaurants available on board. A Restaurant has Tables. A cruise has many on board Staff members, for multiple services to help the Passengers. There are designated Staff members to clean Rooms, to serve at the Restaurant, and a lot more roles.
